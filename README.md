### Lessons Learned
This program represents the first weekend homework assignment during my time in
the SkillDistillery Full Stack development program. I was fortunate enough to
come into this program having already taken a couple of semesters of programming
courses in Java. With that said, I have still learned quite a bit, even with
this first project. I often forget to keep my code DRY and as simple as possible.
This assignment was a great opportunity to reinforce those concepts and to also
reinforce the fundamentals of Java.
